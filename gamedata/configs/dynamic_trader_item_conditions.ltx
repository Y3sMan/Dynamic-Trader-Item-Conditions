;   this mod allows the use of weighted random item conditions, meaning any certain range of item conditions 
;   can have a much higher chance of being chosen than any other range
;
;   Syntax:
;   tradertype  =   probability_1, min_condition_1, max_condition_1 \ probability_2, min_condition_2, max_condition_2, \ etc...
;   for example, 
;   BARMAN = 10, 1, 30 \ 80, 31, 60 \ 10, 61, 100
;   "10, 1, 30"
;   10% chance this condition range is chosen
;   min condition is 1
;   max condition is 30
;
;   Basically, this means that 10% of the time, the item will have a condition between 1% and 30%
;   And, 80% of the time, the item condition will be between 31% and 60%

;   If you want a linear random distribution, i.e. every cond% has an equal 1-in-100 chance:
;   =   100, 1, 100
;
